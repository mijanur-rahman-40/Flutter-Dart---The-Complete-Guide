<p><strong>You can skip this lecture if you're familiar with lists (or "arrays"&nbsp;in other programming languages).</strong></p><p>Lists are core feature of Dart - and actually of pretty much any programming language (in other languages, lists are also called "<strong>arrays</strong>").</p><p>Lists allow you to <strong>group multiple values</strong> (of any type you want)&nbsp;together - you can even have <strong>lists of lists</strong> if you want to (so-called "nested lists").</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">var aListOfText =&nbsp;['Hi', 'This is a list', 'of multiple text snippets (strings)'];</pre><pre class="prettyprint linenums">var aNestedList =&nbsp;[[1,2,3], [1,2,3]]; </pre><p>Lists are created by wrapping the items that should be part of the list into square brackets. Often you have lists of the same type (i.e. a list with only <code>string</code>s or <code>int</code>s in it) but you can absolutely also have lists of mixed types:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">var aMixedList =&nbsp;['Some text', 1, 5.99, ['a nested list!', 1]];</pre><p>Data in lists can be accessed via the <strong>index</strong> of list items - the important thing here is, that this <strong>index starts at zero (0)</strong>!</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">var names =&nbsp;['Max', 'Manu', 'Julie'];
//&nbsp;Max has index 0, Manu has index 1, Julie has index 2
print(names[0]);&nbsp;// prints 'Max' in the console
print(names[2]); // prints 'Julie'&nbsp;in the console
print(names[3]);&nbsp;//&nbsp;would throw an error because there is no element with index 3 in the list</pre><p>You can also find out <strong>how many items</strong> are in a list:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(names.length);&nbsp;// prints 3 - it does NOT&nbsp;print the highest index but simply the amount of items</pre><p>Dart also offers<strong> many methods</strong> (functions that belong to an object) on the List object (like every other value in Dart, lists are an object).</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">names.add('Chris');&nbsp;//&nbsp;this adds 'Chris'&nbsp;as a new element to the end of the list 
names.remove('Max');&nbsp;//&nbsp;this removes 'Max'&nbsp;from the list, all other items would move and fill the gap</pre><p>We'll use many methods throughout the course - so there's no need to explore them all right now.</p><p>If you still want to learn more about lists right now, have a look at this article (Warning:&nbsp;This article contains a lot of information, we'll only dive into later in the course - hence it might be overwhelming right now):&nbsp;<a href="https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#lists" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour#lists</a></p><p>You can also check out the official API&nbsp;docs to get more information + a complete list (how meta!)&nbsp;of all default methods you can call on Dart lists:&nbsp;<a href="https://api.dartlang.org/stable/2.3.1/dart-core/List-class.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://api.dartlang.org/stable/2.3.1/dart-core/List-class.html</a></p>
