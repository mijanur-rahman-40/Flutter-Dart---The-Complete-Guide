<p>In this course, I&nbsp;mostly focus on the device sizes (<code>height</code> and <code>width</code>) when it comes to working with the <code>MediaQuery</code> class.</p><p>As mentioned, it offers way more than that of course. On particularly interesting property is the <code>textScaleFactor</code> property:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">final curScaleFactor = MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor;</pre><p><code>textScaleFactor</code> tells you by how much text output in the app should be scaled. Users can change this in their mobile phone /&nbsp;device settings.</p><p>Depending on your app, you might want to consider using this piece of information when setting font sizes.</p><p><em>Consider this example:</em></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">Text('Always the same size!', style:&nbsp;TextStyle(fontSize:&nbsp;20));</pre><p>This text ALWAYS&nbsp;has a size of <code>20</code> device pixels, no matter what the user changed in his /&nbsp;her device settings.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">Text('This changes!', style:&nbsp;TextStyle(fontSize:&nbsp;20 * curScaleFactor));</pre><p>This text on the other hand also has a size of <code>20</code> if the user didn't change anything in the settings (because <code>textScaleFactor</code> by default is <code>1</code>). But if changes were made, the font size of this text respects the user settings.</p>
