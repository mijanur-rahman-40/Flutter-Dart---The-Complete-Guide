<p>Typically, when working with the Provider package, you provide objects based on your own custom classes.</p><p>This makes sense because you can implement the <code>ChangeNotifier</code> mixin in your classes to to then trigger <code>notifyListeners()</code> whenever you want to update all places in your app that listen to your data.</p><p>But you're not limited to providing objects - you can provide ANY&nbsp;kind of value (lists, numbers, strings, objects without <code>ChangeNotifier</code> mixing, ...).</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">Provider&lt;String&gt;(builder: (ctx)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;'Hi, I am a text!', child:&nbsp;...);</pre><p>You might wonder, how this text can change though - it's a constant text after all. It certainly doesn't implement the <code>ChangeNotifier</code> mixin (the <code>String</code> class, which is built-into Dart, indeed doesn't - just like numbers, booleans etc.).</p><p>It's important to note, that the above snippet uses <code>Provider</code>, NOT&nbsp;<code>ChangeNotifierProvider</code>. The latter indeed only works with objects based on classes that use the ChangeNotifier mixin. And this is the most common use-case, because you typically want to be your global data changeable (and have the app UI react to that).</p><p>But in case you just want to provide some global (constant)&nbsp;value which you can then conveniently use like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">print(Provider.of&lt;String&gt;(context)); // prints 'Hi, I am a text!';&nbsp;does never update!</pre><p>you can do that.</p>
